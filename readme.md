## BOJ Payment and Settlement Statistics

This repo contains the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Payment and Settlement Statistics report from February 2000. While the BOJ doesn't link directly to data from [3 years ago](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/outline/notice_2018/not181031b.htm/), they still have the files up. The BOJ sets up the links to the reports nicely in the form of

    https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/set/kess/release/<year>/kess<2 digit year><2 digit month>.pdf

For example, the link for the August 2018 publication is:

    https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/set/kess/release/2018/kess1808.pdf
